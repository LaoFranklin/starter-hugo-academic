abstract: We propose Neural Canvas, a lightweight 3D platform that integrates
  sketching and a collection of generative AI models to facilitate scenic design
  prototyping. Compared with traditional 3D tools, sketching in a 3D environment
  helps designers quickly express spatial ideas, but it does not facilitate the
  rapid prototyping of scene appearance or atmosphere. Neural Canvas integrates
  generative AI models into a 3D sketching interface and incorporates four types
  of projection operations to facilitate 2D-to-3D content creation. Our user
  study shows that Neural Canvas is an effective creativity support tool,
  enabling users to rapidly explore visual ideas and iterate 3D scenic designs.
  It also expedites the creative process for both novices and artists who wish
  to leverage generative AI technology, resulting in attractive and detailed 3D
  designs created more efficiently than using traditional modeling tools or
  individual generative AI platforms.
