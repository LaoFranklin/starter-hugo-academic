  The imitation of pain sensation in Virtual Reality is considered valuable for
  safety education and training but has been seldom studied. This paper presents
  Douleur, a wearable haptic device that renders intensity-adjustable pain
  sensations with chemical stimulants. Different from mechanical, thermal, or
  electric stimulation, chemical-induced pain is more close to burning
  sensations and long-lasting. Douleur consists of a microfluidic platform that
  precisely emits capsaicin onto the skin and a microneedling component to help
  the stimulant penetrate the epidermis layer to activate the trigeminal nerve
  efficiently. Moreover, it embeds a Peltier module to apply the heating or
  cooling stimulus to the affected area to adjust the level of pain on the skin.
  To better understand how people would react to the chemical stimulant, we
  conducted a first study to quantify the enhancement of the sensation by
  changing the capsaicin concentration, skin temperature, and time and to
  determine suitable capsaicin concentration levels. In the second study, we
  demonstrated that Douleur could render a variety of pain sensations in
  corresponding virtual reality applications. In sum, Douleur is the first
  wearable prototype that leverages a combination of capsaicin and Peltier to
  induce rich pain sensations and opens up a wide range of applications for
  safety education and more.
