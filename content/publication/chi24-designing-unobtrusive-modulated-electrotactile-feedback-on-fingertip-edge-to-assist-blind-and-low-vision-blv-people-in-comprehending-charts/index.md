abstract: >
  Charts are crucial in conveying information across various fields but are
  inaccessible to blind and low vision (BLV) people without assistive
  technology. Chart comprehension tools leveraging haptic feedback have been
  used widely but are often bulky, expensive, and static, rendering them
  inefficient for conveying chart data. To increase device portability, enable
  multitasking, and provide efficient assistance in chart comprehension, we
  introduce a novel system that delivers unobtrusive modulated electrotactile
  feedback directly to the fingertip edge. Our three-part study with twelve
  participants confirmed the effectiveness of this system, demonstrating that
  electrotactile feedback, when applied for 0.5 seconds with a 0.12-second
  interval, provides the most accurate position and direction recognition.
  Furthermore, our electrotactile device has proven valuable in assisting BLV
  participants in comprehending four commonly used charts: line charts,
  scatterplots, bar charts, and pie charts. We also delve into the implications
  of our findings on recognition enhancement, presentation modes, and function
  synergy.
