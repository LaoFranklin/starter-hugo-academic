abstract: Although remote learning is widely used for delivering and capturing
  knowledge, it has limitations in teaching hands-on skills that require nuanced
  instructions and demonstrations of precise actions, such as massage.
  Furthermore,scheduling conficts between instructors and learners often limit
  the availability of real-time feedback,  reducing learning efciency. To
  address these challenges, we developed a synthesis tool utilizing an
  LLM-powered Virtual Teaching Assistant (VTA). This tool integrates multimodal
  instructions that convey precise data, such as stroke patterns and pressure
  control, while providing real-time feedback for learners and summarizing their
  performance for instructors. Our case study with instructors and learners
  demonstrated the efectiveness of these multimodal instructions and the VTA in
  enhancing massage teaching and learning. We then discuss the toolsâ€™ use in
  other hands-on skills instruction and cognitive process diferences in various
  courses.
