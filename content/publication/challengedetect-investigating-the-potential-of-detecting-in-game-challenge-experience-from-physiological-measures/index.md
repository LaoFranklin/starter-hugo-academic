  Challenge is the core element of digital games. The wide spectrum of physical,
  cognitive, and emotional challenge experiences provided by modern digital
  games can be evaluated subjectively using a questionnaire, the CORGIS, which
  allows for a post hoc evaluation of the overall experience that occurred
  during game play. Measuring this experience dynamically and objectively,
  however, would allow for a more holistic view of the moment-to-moment
  experiences of players. This study, therefore, explored the potential of
  detecting perceived challenge from physiological signals. For this, we
  collected physiological responses from 32 players who engaged in three typical
  game scenarios. Using perceived challenge ratings from players and extracted
  physiological features, we applied multiple machine learning methods and
  metrics to detect challenge experiences. Results show that most methods
  achieved a â€¦
