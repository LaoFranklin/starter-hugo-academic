abstract: Being able to analyze and derive insights from data, which we call
  Daily Data Analysis (DDA), is an increasingly important skill in everyday
  life. While the accessibility community has explored ways to make data more
  accessible to blind and low-vision (BLV) people, little is known about how BLV
  people perform DDA. Knowing BLV peopleâ€™s strategies and challenges in DDA
  would allow the community to make DDA more accessible to them. Toward this
  goal, we conducted a mixed-methods study of interviews and think-aloud
  sessions with BLV people (N=16). Our study revealed five key approaches for
  DDA (i.e., overview obtaining, column comparison, key statistics
  identification, note-taking, and data validation) and the associated
  challenges. We discussed the implications of our findings and highlighted
  potential directions to make DDA more accessible for BLV people.
