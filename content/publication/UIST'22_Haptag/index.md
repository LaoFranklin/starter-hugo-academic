  As touch interactions become ubiquitous in the field of human computer
  interactions, it is critical to enrich haptic feedback to improve efficiency,
  accuracy, and immersive experiences. This paper presents HapTag, a thin and
  flexible actuator to support the integration of push button tactile renderings
  to daily soft surfaces. Specifically, HapTag works under the principle of
  hydraulically amplified electroactive actuator (HASEL) while being optimized
  by embedding a pressure sensing layer, and being activated with a dedicated
  voltage appliance in response to usersâ€™ input actions, resulting in fast
  response time, controllable and expressive push-button tactile rendering
  capabilities. HapTag is in a compact formfactor and can be attached,
  integrated, or embedded on various soft surfaces like cloth, leather, and
  rubber. Three common push button tactile patterns were adopted and implemented
  with HapTag. We validated the feasibility and expressiveness of HapTag by
  demonstrating a series of innovative applications under different
  circumstances.
