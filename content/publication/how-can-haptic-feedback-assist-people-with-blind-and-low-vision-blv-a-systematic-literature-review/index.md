abstract: >
  People who are blind and low vision (BLV) encounter numerous challenges in
  their daily lives and work. To support them, various haptic assistive tools
  have been developed. Despite these advancements, the effective utilization of
  these tools—including the optimal haptic feedback and on-body stimulation
  positions for different tasks along with their limitations—remains poorly
  understood. Recognizing these gaps, we conducted a systematic literature
  review spanning two decades (2004–2024) to evaluate the development of haptic
  assistive tools within the HCI community. Our findings reveal that these tools
  are primarily used for understanding graphical information, providing guidance
  and navigation, and facilitating education and training, among other life and
  work tasks. We identified three main limitations: hardware limitations,
  functionality limitations, and UX and evaluation methods limitations. Based on
  these insights, we discuss potential research avenues and offer suggestions
  for enhancing the effectiveness of future haptic assistive technologies.
